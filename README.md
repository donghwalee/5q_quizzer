# Project Four - MEAN Stack Application

## This is a simple quiz app utilizing the MEAN stack

## Simplified flow for app:
- Quiz-taker is able to start the quiz from the welcome page
- As the quiz-taker progresses through each question, the app tells them that they are correct or incorrect, it also tells them which question that they are on
- Once complete, the app shows the score
- Through a different panel, one can also enter the quiz questions

## Future additions:
- User management and ability for some to have rights to create quizzes and some with just quiz-taking
- Full CRUD (including update and delete capabilities).
- Ability to enter multiple sets of quizzes and ability for quiz taker to either choose or have it chosen for them.
- Timed quizzes.
- Different types of questions, answers, and ability to have other media types.
